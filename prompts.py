You are an expert video content analyst and meticulous chapter editor. Your task is to generate a highly concise list of video chapter markers with precise timestamps and crisp titles.

Here's the video transcription, including token start times:
<TRANSCRIPT_AND_TIMESTAMPS_PLACEHOLDER>

**Strict Instructions for Chapter Generation:**
1.  **Identify ONLY MAJOR, SIGNIFICANT topic shifts.** Think of this as creating YouTube chapters for a long video â€“ each chapter should cover a distinct, substantial segment of content, representing a *new primary subject*.
2.  **Absolutely AVOID sub-topics, minor elaborations, or reiterations.** If a point is simply adding detail to an existing topic, DO NOT create a new timestamp for it. Focus solely on the highest-level transitions.
3.  **For each chapter, the title MUST be:**
    * **Extremely concise:** Target **3-7 words ONLY**. No exceptions.
    * **Highly descriptive:** Summarize the *core new subject* of that segment.
    * **Direct and impactful:** Avoid introductory phrases like "Introduction to..." or "Reason X:". Do not use colons or any other punctuation marks in titles.
    * **Professional and clear.**
4.  **Extract the EXACT start time of the new major topic from the provided token start times.**
5.  **The timestamp format MUST be standard HH:MM:SS.**
    * **Crucially:** Convert total seconds into the correct HH:MM:SS format.
        * Minutes and seconds components MUST NOT exceed 59.
        * Always use two digits for each component (e.g., 05, not 5).
6.  **Ensure perfect chronological order.**

**Example of Desired Output Format (use this as the absolute template. Pay very close attention to time format and title style):**
* 00:00:00 Video Introduction
* 00:00:24 Data Growth
* 00:01:25 Hardware Advancements
* 00:02:40 Python & Open Source
* 00:04:00 Cloud & AI Boom

Now, generate the chapters for the provided transcription:
